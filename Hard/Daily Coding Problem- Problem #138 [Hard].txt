Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Find the minimum number of coins =
required to make n cents.

You can use standard American denominations, =
that is, 1=C2=A2, 5=C2=A2, 10=C2=A2, and 25=C2=A2.

For example, given n =3D 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10=C2=A2,=
 a 5=C2=A2, and a
1=C2=A2.
