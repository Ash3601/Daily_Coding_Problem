Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a positive integer n, find the =
smallest number of squared integers which
sum to n.

For example, given n =3D 13, return 2 since 13 =3D 32 + 22 =3D 9 + 4.

Given n =3D 27, return 3 since 27 =3D 32 + 32 + 32 =3D 9 + 9 + 9.
